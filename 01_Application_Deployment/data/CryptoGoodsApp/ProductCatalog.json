ZER0.3","Description":"Russell Westbrook is bringing his typical unabashed energy to Chicago for the All-Star Game—so it makes sense that his feet also arrive in signature style. This special edition of the 'Why Not?' Zer0.3 sports a vibrant, neon color scheme, nodding to the early ‘90s. Elephant print texture on the heel pays homage to the man who changed basketball in the Windy City forever. The result is a standout tribute to Russ’ California roots that refuses to blend in.","Assets":[{"Type":{"$numberInt":"0"},"SubType":{"$numberInt":"0"},"Url":"https://cryptokickstorage.blob.core.windows.net/laborn/laborn_bottom.webp"},{"Type":{"$numberInt":"0"},"SubType":{"$numberInt":"0"},"Url":"https://cryptokickstorage.blob.core.windows.net/laborn/laborn_leftside.webp"},{"Type":{"$numberInt":"0"},"SubType":{"$numberInt":"0"},"Url":"https://cryptokickstorage.blob.core.windows.net/laborn/laborn_rightside.webp"},{"Type":{"$numberInt":"0"},"SubType":{"$numberInt":"0"},"Url":"https://cryptokickstorage.blob.core.windows.net/laborn/laborn_top.webp"}]}

SWACKHAMMER","Subtitle":"LEBRON 17","Description":"The talent at All-Star this year is out of this world, but take a trip to Moron Mountain and you’ll really see all this galaxy has to offer. Ever since the Looney Tunes rocketed Mr. Swackhammer back to the mountain, he’s been working tirelessly to capture—or rather, 'invite' the biggest names in the game to be part of his basketball squad. And his sights are set on snatching The King. Inspired by Mr. Swackhammer, the shoe features neon accents brighter than the Moron Mountain welcome sign. Opponents are about to see LBJ coming from a galaxy away.","Assets":[{"Type":{"$numberInt":"0"},"SubType":{"$numberInt":"0"},"Url":"https://cryptokickstorage.blob.core.windows.net/mrswackhammer/bottom.webp"},{"Type":{"$numberInt":"0"},"SubType":{"$numberInt":"0"},"Url":"https://cryptokickstorage.blob.core.windows.net/mrswackhammer/leftside.webp"},{"Type":{"$numberInt":"0"},"SubType":{"$numberInt":"0"},"Url":"https://cryptokickstorage.blob.core.windows.net/mrswackhammer/rghtside.webp"},{"Type":{"$numberInt":"0"},"SubType":{"$numberInt":"0"},"Url":"https://cryptokickstorage.blob.core.windows.net/mrswackhammer/top.webp"}]}
